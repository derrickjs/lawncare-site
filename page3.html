        <h2> Family owned and operated</h2>

        <p>We have been running this landscaping business since 2015. Over the years we have cut thousands of lawns and finished many landscape projects. I carry this experience with me to every lawn I cut and every Tree I plant. As a hobby farmer I have gained quite a bit of knowledge about growing things. We grow a large vegetable garden every year. Nothing brings a family together like a nice vegetable garden. </p>

        <p>I would be lying if I told you the lawn and landscaping business is my #1 passion and comes before anything else. Although it is a close second, I must be truthful and tell you that my main passion is my family.  My wife and daughter are the foundation of everything I do. My wife helps tremendously with the backend part of the business. My daughter is certainly a motivating factor that helps me to do the best I can do. As parents itâ€™s our responsibility to show our kids how people should treat each other through our own actions. I enjoy instilling values of kindness, hard work, and honesty in my daughter through example. </p>
