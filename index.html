                <p> Lawn care is more than just simply cutting grass. Here at Farmers Touch we take our jobs seriously. We use the best equipment and keep the equipment well maintained. Many people do not realize the importance of this as it is done behind the scenes, but it can make all the difference. It’s important to keep the blades sharp as a clean cut keeps the grass healthy and disease free. It’s important to keep the anti-scalp wheels adjusted correctly so decks don’t mow too short by accident.  It’s also important to keep the machine free from leaks because not only is an oil or gas leak bad for your lawn it’s bad for the environment as well. So, what does all this behind-the-scenes work do for you? It makes a cleaner, healthier cut every time allowing your grass to grow healthy and strong.  Our knowledgeable lawn care experts know what it takes to keep your lawn looking great year to year, cut to cut.</p>
